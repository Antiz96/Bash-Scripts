#Examples of use for an user input error management using "while" and implementation of "read" (with -s, -p arguments) inside some conditions
#Useful if you want to give an authentication to your scripts with Base64 encryption (still better then nothing...).
#To determine the encrypted password you want to use for the script, just run 'echo "yourpassword" | openssl enc -base64' and paste the result in the "pass_encrypted" variable (mine is "1234" in this example)


#!/bin/bash

user="a"
pass_encrypted="MTIzNAo="

echo "Hello, what's your ID ?"

while [ "$user" = "a" ]
do
        read -p "Username : " user
        read -sp "Password : " pass
        encryption=$(echo "$pass" | openssl enc -base64)

if [ "$user" = "Robin" ] && [ "$encryption" = "$pass_encrypted" ]; then
        echo ""
        echo "Good to see you back Robin"
else
        echo ""
        echo "Wrong ID, please retry"
        user="a"
fi
